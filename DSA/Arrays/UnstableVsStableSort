This distinction of Stable and Unstable sort occur when there are
duplicate values in the array.

unsortedArray = {5,9,3,nine,8,4)
Just assume 9, nine both are integers. just to differentiate
between the two 9s.

UNSTABLE SORT:
In an unstable sort after sorting and swapping if the 9 ends up
AFTER the 'nine', then it is an unstable sort.
Which will happen in many sorting algorithms.
sortedArray = {3,4,5,8,nine,9}

STABLE SORT:
In a stable sort after sorting and swapping if the 9 still ends
up BEFORE the 'nine', then it is a stable sort.
This sort is preferred.
sortedArray = {3,4,5,8,9,nine}

Creates problem in some situations like Objects.
Bubble sort = stable sort(only swap when a number is greater than adjacent one)
array[i] > array[i+1] stable sort
array[i] >= array[i+1] unstable sort

Selection Sort = unstable sort
