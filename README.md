# Learn-Java
A Java cheat-sheet from basics. 

Learn-Java is a self-project where I'll learn java side by side documenting it. 

I've started learning Java. 
Derek Banas has a 2 hour long Java playlist on his YouTube channel. 
A simple, to the point, no bullshit video including all the basics you need to get up and start learning. 
So i downloaded Eclipse and started. 

I've been procrastinating for the past few months now. 
And this was high time that I pick up something and complete it. 
Hence I've decided to document what I've learnt and put it out. 
Let github be a silent audience of this project for myself. 

I started with JavaSE-14 library.
But a lot of functions are not available in JavaSE-14. 
So I'll recommend you to add Java 1.8 library.
Even Java 11 will work. But it still might lack in a few functions.
So I'll say either go with Java 1.8 or Java 1.7.
And these files are writen on Eclipse itself with comments to summarize the class itself.
