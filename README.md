# Learn-Java
A Java cheat-sheet from basics. 

Learn-Java is a self-project where I'll learn java side by side documenting it. 

I've started learning Java. 

1. Derek Banas has a 2 hour long Java playlist on his YouTube channel. 
   A simple, to the point, no bullshit video including all the basics you need to get up and start learning. (not really beginner friendly)
   So i downloaded Eclipse and started.

2. "Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers" is a Udemy course by Tim Buchalka. 
   It is a bestselling course on Java. Totally beginner friendly. With basics to some advance topics.
   INTELLIJ BRANCH
   
3. "Data Structures and Algorithms Deep Dive Using Java" is another Udemy course by Tim Buchalka.
   This course is all about DSA. A great one above it.

I've been procrastinating for the past few months now. 
And this was high time that I pick up something and complete it. 
Hence I've decided to document what I've learnt and put it out. 
Let github be a silent audience of this project for myself. 

I'm using amazon correto (java 11).
